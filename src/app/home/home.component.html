                                   Hi! I'm Chris.  I am a very passionate Full-Stack Application Developer working at AINS in Gaithersburg, MD.  As a long-time musician, I received a Bachelor's and Master's in Music Performance and maintained a professional career earlier on in my life.  Transitioning to Computer Science, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Wayne State University.  Highly motivated to write clean and effective code.  I enjoy working with ASP.NET, SQL Server, and C#.

                                   I inherited many skills transitioning from music to programming.  Preparing for auditions and improving my technique and artistry has taught me how to learn and program efficiently and meticulously.  Most of all, working with many people from teachers to orchestral players has brought me communicative and soft-skills necessary in the IT workfield.  Please enjoy my website.
