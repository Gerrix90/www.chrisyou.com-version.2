              I inherited many skills transitioning from music to programming.  Preparing for auditions and improving my technique and artistry has taught me how to learn and program efficiently and meticulously.  Most of all, working with many people from teachers to orchestral players setting has brought me communicative and soft-skills necessary in the IT workfield.  Please enjoy my website.
